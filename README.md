# SpellTower Clash

SpellTower Clash is a medieval fantasy-themed tower defense game built using Python and Pygame. In this game, you place fantasy turret towers on a grid to defend against waves of cartoonish, cutesy demons. As you progress, you can upgrade your towers and collect passive buffs to boost your defenses.
